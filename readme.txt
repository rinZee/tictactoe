This is a classic TicTacToe game in a web page. This project is my attempt to build something from vanilla html, css and js
 as a way to test my foundational knowledge of basic html, css and javascript.

I plan on using this project as a diary of my learning journey. And I will use this text document as a daily journal documenting
 all the problems I'll face every day and the solution to those problems.

 Day 0
 Progress made
 - built the base of the project(html,css and js) and linked them together.
 - created a repository for the project on git, linked it to the local project and made the first commit

 Day 1
 Problems I'm facing
 - For the game TicTacToe I am going to need a image with two horizontal and two vertical lines crisscrossing on the  webpage
  where users can select their move either the cross or a circle
 Soultion
 - Upon my research the solution for this problem was canvas element which is an html element used to draw 2D graphics via scripting
 
 Problems broken down into small size
 Today i mostly looked a little bit into the html canvas. I added the canvas element and made the border. Some problems I'm facing 
 - adding 2 inner lines vertically and horizontally in the canvas for the TicTacToe game
 - every section of the TicTacToe box should have state that can be toggled on/off
 - add some eventlisteners to the individual boxes which when clicked should toggle the state on/off
